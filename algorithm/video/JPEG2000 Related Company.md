As the ADV202/ADV212 follows the JPEG2000 (J2K) -ISO/IEC15444-1 image compression standard, it will be compatible with imaging applications that adhere to this standard. Below are links to companies that provide products and services in conjunction with JPEG2000, from software codecs to hardware and software design:

1. Agility Video  
Agility Video provides ADV202/ADV212 design support and consulting services, hardware - in Network camera, Network codec and PCI card forms, scaleable DVR / NVR and video transaction / POS auditing software - all available for evaluation, demonstration and OEM licensing. Designs demonstrate the facility of ADV202/ADV212 and JPEG2000, in providing robust, IP based, streaming, low latency, multi-resolutional, multi-platform video in the CCTV industry.

2. J2K-Codec
J2K-Codec is an easy-to-use JPEG2000 decoder, specially modified to support ADV202/ADV212 chip. It can handle down-sampled U and V components, and has performance suitable for live-video decoding. There is also a special decoding mode (automatically activated for video images from ADV202/ADV212), which boosts performance and eliminates interlacing artifacts.

3. Aware Inc.
Aware provides software development solutions for decoding ADV202/ADV212 data streams, complete with reference applications and source code. Aware was the first to commercialize wavelet compression, and for the past 6 years has been heavily involved in the JPEG 2000 standards bodies, R&D, and delivery of commercially supported JPEG2000 software development tools and products for the medical, geospatial, library, digital cinema, and video markets.

4. Kakadu Software
Gastager Systemtechnik GmbH
As the designer of the PCI-based ADV202/ADV212 evaluation board, Gastager Systemtechnik GmbH provides various development platforms using the ADV202/ADV212, from simple encode / decode demo boards (ADV202/ADV212 VidPipe) to high-end processing units that include a Blackfin DSP for post-processing JPEG2000 data. The JPEG2000 Net Module, a video/audio codec module, which transmits data over 10/100 BaseT Ethernet with latency of <150ms is also available.

5. LuraTech GmbH
Morgan Multimedia
Probably the fastest JPEG2000 software codec available on PC today! Includes decoder and encoder. Fully interoperable with the ADV202/ADV212. Multi-threaded and highly optimized for Intel x86 and compatible CPUs (MMX, SSE, SSE2, Hyper-Threading, Multi Core and Multi CPU). Supports Video For Windows and DirectShow API. Also available as a low-level SDK including documentation and sample source code.

6. RV-Media Ltd 
RV-Media provides software JPEG2000 decoder that can be used for decoding of ADV202/ADV212 streams. JPEG2000 codec is available as SDK with low level C API and easy-to-use C++ API. Also RV-Media offers application development services in different areas related to JPEG2000 and digital image processing.
