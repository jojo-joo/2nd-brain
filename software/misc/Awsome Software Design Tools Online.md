## Cryptography
- [base64.guru](http://base64.guru) conver base64 from/to ASCII/Audio/File/Hex/Image/PDF/Text/Video.

## Drawing
- [asciiflow](https://asciiflow.com) draw graph by ascii, can easy copy to text file.

## Filter
- [Tony Fisher](http://www.piclist.com/techref/uk/ac/york/cs/www-users/http/~fisher/index.htm) generate c code from filter coefs(eg IIR/FIR/LC/PLL), this is the **1st** backup site.
- [Tony Fisher](http://www.massmind.org/techref/uk/ac/york/cs/www-users/http/~fisher/index.htm) generate c code from filter coefs(eg IIR/FIR/LC/PLL), this is the **2nd** backup site.
- [Tony Fisher](https://www.anteeo.se/fisher/mkfilter/) generate c code from filter coefs(eg IIR/FIR/LC/PLL), this is the **3rd** backup site.
