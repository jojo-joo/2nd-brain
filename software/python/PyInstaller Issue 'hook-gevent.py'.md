You can see that the error I encountered is related to the missing content in the `pyinstaller-Hooks` file, and there are four solutions:

1. **Uninstall and reinstall PyInstaller**

    ```
    pip uninstall pyinstaller
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2. **IPython Problem**

    The error may be caused by an outdated IPython installed in the environment. We can try updating it to the latest version.

    ```
    pip install --upgrade IPython
    Update pip
    ```

3. **Upgrade PIP**
    ```
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

4. **Reinstall PyInstaller completely**
    ```
    pip install --force-reinstall --no-binary :all: pyinstaller
    ```
5. **Final Solution**

    If the error persists, my friends, if the first four methods still cannot solve your problem, then you can only resort to this:
    
    First, go to GitHub to download an advanced version of the PyInstaller package, address: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller
    
    After downloading and decompressing it, find the hooks folder and copy (or cut) it to your Python environment directory, as shown below
    
    It is worth noting that there are two directories for Python:
    
    One is in `C:\Program Files\Python39`
    
    One is in `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39`
    
    According to your error prompt, we should copy the file to the former directory. After that, packaging Python normally is okay!
